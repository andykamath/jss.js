#JSS.js

Sometimes, writing regular CSS is just too simple.

JSS.js complicates your process by taking your CSS, processing it via jQuery, then returning your CSS back to you

##Install
1) Download jss.js to your project directory
<br><br>
2) Add jQuery and jss.js to your HTML head node
<br><br>
3) Import all your CSS right after you import the JS files via jss.import('/path/to/css.css') in a script tag. Do that as many times as you need to for all your CSS files!
<br><br>
4) Add CSS to your CSS files!
