#JSS.js

Sometimes, writing regular CSS is just too simple.

JSS.js complicates your process by taking your CSS, processing it via jQuery, then returning your CSS back to you

##Install
1) Download jss.js to your project directory
2) Add jQuery and jss.js to your HTML head node
3) Import all your CSS right after you import the JS files
	<br><br>
	<plaintext><script type="text/javascript">jss.import(`/path/to/your/css.css`);</script></plaintext>
	<strong>Do that as many times as you need to for all your CSS files</strong>
	<br><br>
4) Add CSS to your CSS files!
